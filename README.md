# Flights-Data-Exploration-Challenge-by-Mustafa-Badshah
In this challenge, you'll explore a real-world dataset containing flights data from the US Department of Transportation.
Steps Covered in This Project:
# Data Loading and Preparation:

Loaded flight data from a CSV file.
Separated data into features (X) and target (Y).
Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Examined summary statistics for numeric fields.
Identified and handled missing values.
Investigated outliers in departure and arrival delays.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Analyzed the distribution of departure and arrival delays.
Compared carrier performance based on arrival delays.
Explored arrival delays across different days of the week.
Model Building and Evaluation:

Built a linear regression model to predict arrival delays.
Trained the model and evaluated its performance using metrics like MSE and R-squared.
Implemented a random forest model for comparison and evaluated its performance.
Identifying Routes with Delay Issues:

Identified routes with the most late arrivals.
Calculated and visualized routes with the highest average arrival delays.
Files Included:
flight_data.csv: Dataset used for analysis.
flight_delay_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all the analysis and code.
README.md: This file summarizing the project.
Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
